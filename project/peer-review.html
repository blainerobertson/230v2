        <h1>Peer Reviews</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="requirements">Why</h2>
        <p>You may ask, "Why a peer review?", the answer is, "To get feedback and have time to fix errors." This process will give you ideas of things you missed or could improve from different viewpoints. Take this feedback and address the issues raised in order to maximize your score when assessed by the professor or teaching assistant.</p>

        <h2>When</h2>
        <p>The peer review will take place in class as specified in the course materials for weeks 12, 13 and 14.</p>
        <h2>How</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Organize yourselves into groups of three (3) class members.</li>
          <li>Each person will review the site of the others in their group, excluding their own.</li>
          <li>Your project should be as complete as possible by the time the review is done.</li>
          <li>Each individual will review the site using the provided grading sheet, an Excel template file, available in the course Project module when the project is available.</li>
          <li>On the sheet, fill in the developer and reviewer information and provide a score for each item and written feedback for the site as a whole.</li>
          <li>Save the name of the document as the site's owners name, plus "review" (e.g. John Smith Review.xlsx)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Submitting</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Email a copy of your review to the site owner before leaving class.</li>
          <li>Submit a copy of each review document you completed to the peer review dropbox in the week 13 module (you should submit 2 individual files) before leaving class.</li>
          <li>Each review is worth 5 points for a total of 10 points total.</li>
          <li><strong>If you fail to participate in the peer review process you will lose the 10 points for the two peer reviews AND your Acme project score will also be penalized 50%!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
        <p>Review the Grading Matrix when it becomes available during week 12.</p>
