    <h1>Collaboration</h1>
    <p>Collaboration - the ability to work together to accomplish a task, goal or outcome - is a skill that is consistently mentioned by employers as a requirement for new and seasoned employees. In this course you will be requried to work with others on a weekly basis using both the discussion board and team meetings. Each individual is responsible for her or his own work, but interacting, supporting, assisting and collaborating are desireable and required in this class.</p>
    <h2>Learning Team</h2>
