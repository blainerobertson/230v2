    <h1>The Learning Process-Learn, Do, Be</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This class follows a process of learning that Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles describes well in his address:&nbsp;<a href="//www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">The Challenge to Become</a>. Read the first half of the talk to the line: "The gospel challenges us to be 'converted,' which requires us to&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;and to&nbsp;<em>become"</em>&nbsp;(time marker 7:14 if you are watching the video). Also look through LDS President Thomas S. Monson's address:&nbsp;<a href="//www.lds.org/ensign/2008/11/to-learn-to-do-to-be?lang=eng" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">To Learn, to Do, to Be</a>.</p>

    <p>As you are reading/watching, think about how you can apply the concepts both leaders are teaching to learning web frontend development. Think of the differences and implications between those two small words, &ldquo;know&rdquo; and &ldquo;do.&rdquo; According to LDS Prophet Spencer W. Kimball, &ldquo;To&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t enough. The devils know and tremble; the devils know everything. We have to&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;something.&rdquo; How might moving from&nbsp;<em>knowing</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>doing</em>&nbsp;to even&nbsp;<em>becoming</em>&nbsp;allow you to learn the course concepts and skills most deeply?</p>

    <h2>Stop Being a Student, Start Becoming a Professional</h2>

    <p>You have been a student for years, but the problem with being a student is that what you learn and do is often compartmentalized and you are only asked to remember it for the short-term. In addition, we get too used to only meeting basic expectations. For example, I recently had a student respond to my feedback regarding his not doing something that would have made the usability of a web form a much better experience for site visitors by saying, "Was I supposed to do that? I didn't see it as a requirement."</p>

    <p>In the web development field, as in many others, professionals must bring all of their knowledge, know-how, skills, and problem-solving abilities to find solutions to the problems they encounter. The experiences you have in this course are designed to help you act like, and indeed become, professionals as you move from&nbsp;<em>knowing</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>doing</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>becoming</em>. That concept will guide all you do in this course. However, you will not need to do it alone. Please take advantage of the daily opportunity to work with others&mdash;students&nbsp;and your instructor. If you will do so, learning web frontend development will be an exciting and eye-opening experience for you.</p>

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>One of the means of interacting with others in the class is to serve as a peer reviewer and ask for peer reviews of your own work. This tried and true development concept is widely used in companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Microsoft. Its goal is to improve the product by allowing multiple people to see, analyze, and provide input on software (code), processes, and solutions to problems during their development.</p>

    <h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
    <p>This review can be arranged by using the discussion boards found in each of the weekly modules or through video conferencing software (Skype, Google Hangouts, Adobe Connect, etc). Please take advantage of the boards to ask questions, provide answers and keep a written record of these interactions.</p>

    <h2>Test, Test, Test</h2>
    <p>Don't forget to&nbsp;<a href="//badhtml.com/html-validation/" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">validate HTML markup</a>&nbsp;and CSS before publishing web content and being your own Quality Assurance checker after doing so!</p>
