    <h1>Mobile Browsing Activity</h1>

    <h2>One Day</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite scenes in the Disney movie "Hercules" is when Hades is trying to convince Hercules to stop being a hero for just 24 hours. A lot can happen in one 24 hour day!</p>

    <p>Now, I am not trying to convince you to stop being a hero, instead I want you to <b>spend one day (24 hours) using only the internet browser (not a dedicated app, use the browser) on your smart phone</b> as you do your normal web browsing so that you can be a hero later. I understand that sometimes in order to get homework done you can't, so in those cases use your laptop or desktop. But for all other browsing for that day use only the browser(s) on your phone.</p>

    <p>Simply put, I want you to pay attention to the web sites that you would normally visit, but only on a "teeny, tiny screen". As you do this ask yourself:</p>

    <ul>
     <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
     <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
     <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
     <li>Any frustrations?</li>
     <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you spend this time, <i><b>keep track of those sites that work well and those that don't</b></i>. Write them down (with a few notes) if you need to!</p>

    <h3>What Next?</h3>
    <p>When this activity is done, you will share your experience during the Design and Analysis assessment.</p>
