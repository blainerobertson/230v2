    <h1>Consider Your Clients</h1>

    <p>When planning any web project - a site, an application or other content to be delivered via the Internet - there are fundamental consideration and questions that need to be answered concerning those who visit your site - the <i>target audience</i> who are referred to individually as <i>the client</i>. Consider each of the following:</p>

    <h2>Who are you trying to reach?</h2>
    <p>The audience as a whole</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Age</li>
     <li>Occupation (student, professional, etc...)</li>
     <li>Income</li>
     <li>Family status</li>
     <li>Experience level with the topic of your site and its content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is the client doing when he/she visits the site?</h2>
    <p>How will this affect their use of the site?</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Sitting at home using a desktop or laptop machine.</li>
     <li>Laying bed, using their tablet or phone, prior to sleep.</li>
     <li>Commuting to work on public transportation on a tablet or phone.</li>
     <li>In a restaurant, using their phone, while eating.</li>
     <li>In their public library using their laptop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What does the client want?</h2>
    <p>What is she trying to do? What content is he trying to find? Both of these can be described using a scenario (description of the cleint's actions).</p>

    <ul>
     <li>What does it cost to ride the bus from Golden Gate park to Fisherman's wharf?</li>
     <li>Where is the nearest ATM machine?</li>
     <li>What are the hours for my neighborhood pharmacy?</li>
     <li>Does that store carry a polo shirt in my size? What color options exist? Price?</li>
     <li>How do I make a CSS-driven dropdown navigation bar?</li>
     <li>What's the weather going to be this weekend at the trail I'm planning to hike?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where is the client located?</h2>
    <p>Does the visitor's geographic location impact the content delivery?</p>
    <ul>
     <li>I'm driving and need directions to the hospital.</li>
     <li>How far from the airport is the hotel?</li>
     <li>I need someone to wash my windows.</li>
     <li>Is there a&nbsp;veterinary&nbsp;clinic nearby?</li>
     <li>I'd like that pizza delivered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When is the site being visited?</h2>
    <p>How does the time affect the content delivery?</p>

    <ul>
     <li>It's 9pm and I just broke my leg.</li>
     <li>It's 1am, the pizza delivery is at the door and I don't have any cash.</li>
     <li>It's 2pm and I need a haircut before my job interview.</li>
     <li>It's 6:45pm and I want tickets to the movie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How are clients accessing the site?</h2>
    <p>What are the capabilities and limitations of their device?</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A desktop machine, fast broadband connection.</li>
     <li>A Kindle Fire HD using wi-fi at McDonalds</li>
     <li>An iPhone 7 Plus using 4G LTE</li>
     <li>A Samsung Note 6 with a commuter train wi-fi connection</li>
     <li>A Windows Surface Pro 4 with a home dial-up connection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="principles">Guiding Principles of Development</h2>
    <p>As you focus on the client in your development you will find that these four principles, when observed, will help you give the client what they want and in a meaningful way.</p>
