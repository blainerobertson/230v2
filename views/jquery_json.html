				<h2>Watch For Comprehension</h2>
				<p>You are not being asked to do the activities in these videos as you were in last week's videos. However, you will be required to do something very similar, but using a different API, in the assessment. So, it is important that you have a basic understanding of the steps and techniques demonstrated in these videos and the preparatory materials for this week.</p>

				<p class="callout"><i><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; JavaScript and JQuery are very powerful but sometimes confusing. You are strongly encouraged to work together in your learning team to assist one another as you work on the activities and assessments mentioned in this and all lessons!</i>
