        <h1>jQuery: Assessment</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The purpose of this week was to get you familiar with basic JavaScript concepts and implementing the jQuery library. As stated earlier it was not to turn you into a jQuery ninja in one week. However, you have been asked to watch a series of videos and follow along with them to gain actual experience writing and using jQuery and build muscle memory while gaining the experience.</p>

        <h2>Assessment</h2>
        <p>When done following along with the videos and finishing the code of the individual video files, you are to alter the Lesson4 folder and its files by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Modifying the folder name to meet the web naming rules.</li>
          <li>Comment out the script tags in all html pages that refer to the local version of jQuery.</li>
         <li>Create a script tag that uses the CDN path for the current, minified version of jQuery found on jQuery.com's downloads page - <a href="https://code.jquery.com/" title="Open the jQuery download page in a new tab" target="_blank">https://code.jquery.com/</a>.</li>
          <li>Create links to the other html pages in the Lesson4 folder in the footer of the index.htm file of the Lesson4 folder. Style the links using Flexbox so they are horizontal and fit within the footer.</li>
          <li>Upload the completed "Lesson4" folder to your web site.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a link to the index page of the Lesson4 folder in your own temporary home page on your web site.</li>
          <li>Upload your temporary home page with the new link added.</li>
          <li>Once everything is uploaded to your site, test all links to ensure they work!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
        <h3>Objective 5 (30 points)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Each web page (6 total) will be checked for operation according to &nbsp;the finished behavior shown in the Lesson4 videos and as shown below:
         <ul>
           <li>Index - 3 behaviors: prepend items to the list, validate the form, add a name to the name field if empty.</li>
          <li>Animated menu - 5 menus slide out from the left.</li>
          <li>Dropdown menu - submenus drop down from menu bar.</li>
          <li>Fruit Basket - six boxes are created from a json object.</li>
          <li>Insert HTML - data is moved between boxes using buttons.</li>
          <li>Toggle buttons - buttons animate to show they are pressed or not.</li>
           </ul>

         </li>
          <li>Each will be graded "Complete" or not based on their operation.</li>
          <li>Each page's completed behavior will be worth 5 points.</li>
        </ol>
